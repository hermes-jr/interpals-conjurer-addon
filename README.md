This browser extension allows you to revive some missing conversations on interpals.net. Sometimes the website notifies you for a brief moment about new messages but they're never found in private messages page after that. This extension introduces a temporary duct-tape kind of solution to that problem. It injects an extra script to the website. While the website page is opened, the script tracks notifications and stores them locally in your browser. It also displays the list of persistent notifications on the lower right of your page. No information is being sent outside your machine or even to other processes. Everything is handled locally.

This is an NOT an official InterPals software.
